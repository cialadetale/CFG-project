How to get the top track in the country? 
- Get Categories
https://api.spotify.com/v1/browse/categories/{category_id}/playlists
Imho there is no need for a new API call. Just add two new Categories ("charts", "viral").
- category_id = "charts" or "viral"
- then, to the playlists at the end: /playlists?country={}
{} is our two-sign country e.g. PL, GB
toplists > playlists > 2? > tracks [0]
